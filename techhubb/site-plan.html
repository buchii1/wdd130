      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I want to build a technical support website. The features I want to add to the website are: A community support page whereby users can interact with each other and share ideas relating to tech. A dedicated login page whereby only authenticated users can have access to chat in the community hangout page. The website will also feature a tech blog page where I get to post latest tech trends and updates. The goal of the website is to promote the study and knowledge of tech by bringing the users closer to the trends going on in the digital space. Finally, by signing up and becoming a member of the community, the users get to build life-long and meaningful relationships.

This can be workers, programmers, stay at home mums and dad, and also people who are struggling on how to get into tech. I plan on expanding my audience as my website gains popularity.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Tech Blog</h3>
      <p>
        How to use images with technology for websites
        <ul>
          <li>Images with technology are particulary suited for use with websites, particulary sites
            that focus on technology, digital communication, information, or other related fields. 
            Used as headers, images with technology should be bold and intersting.
          </li>
          <li>This is a part of your website where you really want to grab some attention and bring
            your visitors into the experience of your page. Don't go vague here -- chose an image
            with familiar elements presented in a new or intersting way. Once you've moved your viewer
            into the page itself, your background images can be more vague and a bit more subtle -- 
            choose abstract or muted images that won't distract from your primary content.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you're pairing images with technology with your body text, you want images that relate to 
            what you're talking about, so don't pick unrelated visuals. Find a way to summarize what you're 
            saying in the text with a striking image. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words!
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h3>Gadgets Store</h3>

        As part of our mission of delivering quality and up-to-date service to our customers, we have an
        online store where you can purchase new tech gadgets ranging from printers, HDD, SSD, modem, mouse,
        keyboards, smart watches, fitness trainer, among others. We do not own a physical store at the moment,
        although we are making plans in acquiring one in the nearest future. When you place an order through
        our store, we liase with the producer in order to acquire the product and ship to you. We have a 1 year
        exclusive warranty which is different from that of the producer. <br>
