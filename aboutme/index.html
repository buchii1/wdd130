            I was born into the church. I served a full-time mission in Nigeria Lagos Mission from January, 2019 - January, 2022.
            My favorite Book of Mormon scripture is 2 Nephi 32 vs 8. I quote: "And now, my beloved brethren, 
            I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. 
            For if ye would hearken unto  the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye 
            must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray."
